# Netflix React - Frontend Clone 🔴

As part of my training at [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) to become a full-stack developer, we were tasked with recreating a simple [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/fr/) website, using the .json file given by the bootcamp.

_This website is just an exercise and will not be deployed or used, besides as a portfolio piece. All the images and links used are not my property._

## Overview 🚀
